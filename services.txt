With Elasticsearch your searching can be scored for exactness letting you dig through your data set for those close matches and near misses which you could be missing. IBM Compose for Elasticsearch makes Elasticsearch even better by managing it for you. This includes offering an easy, auto-scaling deployment system which delivers high availability and redundancy, automated no-stop backups and much more. Note: Compose via Bluemix does not give access to the Compose UI at this time, see https://help.compose.com/docs/bluemix-compose-support for more details.
